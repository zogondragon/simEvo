simEvo
======

simEvo - a free open-source simulation game based on Evolution theory

OS : Ubuntu 12.04, (possible cross-platform)
PL : Java ? Java with GUI (swing?)

Inspired by SimEarth (Maxis)

1. Brief Introduction
    * SimEarth + More combat oriented evolution strategy game
    * Possibility of intelligent creatures other than Human
    * Many attributes to model the physical / mental ability of species
    * Simple but interesting abstraction of mutant and evolution
    * Achievements (sub-goals) to encourage players 
    * Scoring system to compete with other players
    * Conquer the Earth (or whatever Planet X) with your species!


2. Game Concepts
    * Species will have "Evolution Point", or Evolution Complexity, 
      which is accumulated upon mutation. This "EP" can be distributed 
      upon many attributes such as Lifespan, Intelligence, Weight, 
      Speed, and Ferocity. 

3. Future Plan
    * Make the very basic structure using Java SE 7 (2012-11-17)
