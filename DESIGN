Design and Source Tree
======================

data/
    Data files (possible mod easier) or file-based DB.

engine/
    Main game engine. Independent from view(visual representation).

scripts/
    AI, behavior model, physical model, and combat behavior should 
    be scripts so that developers can modify these in real-time and 
    experiment more.

view/
    interface such as CLI or GUI to represent the status of engine to 
    players
